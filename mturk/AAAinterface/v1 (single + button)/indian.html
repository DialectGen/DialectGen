        <p>The Dialectal Prompts and Standard American English Prompts below are constructed via examples from the Oxford English Dictionary and online crowdsourcing. Your role as an annotator is to further certify the prompts by answering the two questions below based on your knowledge, intuition, and any external resources you may find helpful. </p>

        <p>Click “I don’t know” for examples where you feel unsure about your answer.</p>

      <positive-example>
        <h3>AAE Prompt: A man driving his whip. </h3>
        <h3>SAE Prompt: A man driving his car.</h3>
        <p>In this case, the African American English (AAE) prompt is not ambiguous because although the word “whip” has a different meaning in Standard American English. The sentence structure (driving a whip) makes that interpretation unreasonable. Therefore, you should choose “Yes” for both Q1 and Q2 in this case.</p>
        
      </positive-example>
  
      <negative-example>
        <h3>BE Prompt: A woman playing football. </h3>
        <h3>SAE Prompt: A woman playing soccer.</h3>
        <p>In this case, the British English (BE) prompt is ambiguous because it has a reasonable alternative interpretation in the Standard American English (SAE) context (the woman could be playing American football or gridiron instead of soccer). Therefore, you should choose “Yes” for Q1 and “No” for Q2 in this case.</p>
